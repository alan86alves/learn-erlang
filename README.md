## Erlang

* Erlang, foi desenvolvida pela Ericson em 1986, o objetivo era resolver o problema de telefonia da época. Possui uma VM chamada BEAM que é extratamente poderosa. Ela foi construida para garantir uma disponibilidade de 99,9999999%. O nome Erlang faz uma referência a "Ericsson Language".

* Joe Armstrong remarked in an interview with Rackspace in 2013: “If Java is 'write once, run anywhere', then Erlang is 'write once, run forever'.”[14]

* The Erlang view of the world, as Joe Armstrong, co-inventor of Erlang, summarized in his PhD thesis:

	* Everything is a process.

	* Processes are strongly isolated.

	* Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.

	* Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.

	* Processes have unique names.

	* If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.

	* Processes share no resources.

	* Error handling is non-local.

	* Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.
